# Kai’s Background:

_“I bought my first cryptocurrency in 2014, without really knowing what crypto and blockchain was all about. Then, in 2017, I became more active in the crypto community. I followed a couple of projects and became a Product Council Member, Ambassador, and Adviser, on multiple projects. I also founded my own company, Expedition MC."_

_My translation of the Hydrogen Whitepaper helped me to understand Project Hydro, and led to me becoming an active supporter/community member, and finally a Decentralized Ambassador."_

# Kai’s Vision for Hydro:

_“At this time, my vision and priorities for the project are community and business development. Nowadays community support and partnerships are really import to (blockchain related) startups. By organising community and business related meetings and events, I will help to expand future business opportunities.”_
