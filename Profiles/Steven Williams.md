# Steven’s Background:

*“I’ve been working in the financial services industry for just about 5 years. I am now a product manager for one of the largest investment management firms in the world, specifically working on the mobile apps. I have a bachelor’s degree in Psychology and I’m currently pursuing an MBA. I came across Hydrogen a few months ago, and being a part of a large financial services firm, I understand how important it is to transform our digital capabilities. Hydrogen is trying to do that through blockchain and I agree with their vision of building the Financial Web 3.0."* 

# Steven’s Vision for Hydro:

*“As a product manager, I often wear many hats. I plan to be involved in many processes, from helping bridge gaps that developers have with the platform as they are on-boarded, to bringing together fellow DAs (DA meet ups, DA committee, bi-weekly DA calls, etc.) so that as ambassadors, we are a cohesive yet diverse group. I want to implement a vision of how we can best serve the Hydro community of developers and users alike."*
